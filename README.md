# github-ui

###### This project is aimed at Creating A UI which shows the top repositories of GitHub filtered according to languages.

### Frontend
* #### HTML/CSS
* #### JavaScript
* #### Bootstrap
  ###### It is a frontend framework which makes it is easier to design elements in HTML without worrying much about CSS(Bootstrap uses it's own CSS, JS, jQuery). Easy to use and saves a lot of time when creating basic/minimal frontend
  
  
## Done:
* #### Implemented a Table like UI to diplay the repos. 

## To-Do:
* Use a backend service to make API calls to Github to fetch information of top repos filtering by language used.
